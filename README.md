OMG, just got back from watching The Parenting. 😂 Seriously, what a ride! Like, I was thinking it was gonna be some typical, cheesy family drama, but nah, way more intense than I thought. You know what I mean? Maybe it's just me being tired, but I swear the dad was just a mess. Relatable af tho, not gonna lie. Every parent I've ever known, rolled into one, and like... on steroids. His sarcasm? I feel it in my soul.

> And the kid? What was with the rollercoaster of emotions?? 😅 I mean, I get it, teenagers and all, but wow, that was something. One moment they're all I hate you, you're the worst, and the next, they're like, You're my hero, dad. I'm definitely not doing this movie justice just rambling like this, but whatever! And their relationship with the weird neighbor? I can't even. Made me laugh more than I probably should admit.

Honestly, if you download the movie, make sure you've got snacks, 'cause you’re definitely gonna wanna munch while watching. Oh, and the mom character. She was both iconic and horrifically relatable. Balancing like 10 million things at once and still managing to toss some sass around. I'm low-key inspired by her, but also exhausted just thinking about it. 😂

Anyway, I guess it did its job making me feel all the feels. One second I'm chuckling, next I'm like, Wow, are we really going there? If you've not checked it out yet, maybe watch the movie when you're in the mood for some emotional whiplash — like, in the best way possible. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { return 0; }
```

But yeah, enough of my rambling. I’m just blabbering at this point. Catch it sometime if you need a good mix of feels and laughs. Lemme know what you think if you do! Peace out! ✌️
